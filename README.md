# **CodeConductor MCP**

CodeConductor MCP bundle for Claude Desktop. Install the `.mcpb` to **auto-register the orchestrator** and enable rich IDE-aware operations — including file access, code navigation, and git tooling. When licensed, unlocks **Pro-level features** like stash, file diff, and command execution.

## What It Does

The **CodeConductor MCP server** powers Claude Desktop’s IDE orchestration layer, exposing **24 tools** for:

*   **Code Intelligence** – symbol/context lookup, navigation
*   **File Operations** – open, read, write, append, search, diff
*   **Git Integration** – status, log, commit, stash, branch, etc.
*   **Command Tools** – terminal-style commands, env info, reset

All tools are secured with tier enforcement (Free vs Pro), and work offline via signed license files.
